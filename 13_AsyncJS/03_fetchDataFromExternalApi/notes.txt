What is An API ? 
- Application Programming Interfrace
- Contract provided by one piece of software to another
- structured request and response
 - we just worked with an API that takes a request and responds with jokes 

 REST APIS 
 - Representational State Transfer
 - Architectural style for designing networked applications
 - replies on a stateless, client-server protocol, almost always http
 - Treats server objects as resources that can be created / destroyed
 -can be used by virtually any programming language
 - all apis have their own rules and structure


 HTTP Requests
 - GET : Retrieve data from a speicified resource
 - POST : Submit data to be processed to a specifiied resource e.g add a user
 - PUT: Update a specified resource
 - DELETE : Delete a specified resource 

 -HEAD : Same as GET but does not return a body
 - OPTIONS : Returns the supported http methods
 - PATCH : Update partial resources 


 API ENDPOINTS - urls that we access to do certain things 

- common end pts for GET : 
GET https://url.com/api/users - get all users
GET https://url.com/api/users/1 - get single user 

With post, put, and delete requets, we need to send data along w these requests

POST https://url.com/api/users - ADD USER

PUT https://url.com/api/users/1 - update user

DELETE https://url.com/api/users/1 - delete user
